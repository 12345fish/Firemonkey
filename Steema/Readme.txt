  VCL and FireMonkey examples of TFastLine series with
  pseudo-realtime animation.

  Notes:

  VCL demo has better speed than FMX as it bypasses the VCL
  canvas to call GDI+ DrawLines api directly.

  Demos are compiled with Embarcadero Studio XE7 but should 
  also be compatible with any Delphi version from Delphi 5.0 
  (VCL) and RAD XE2 (FMX).

  Mobile devices are much slower than typical desktops so
  the animation frames per second will be much smaller.
